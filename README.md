#  Interpretable Multi Labeled Bengali Toxic Comments Classification using Deep Learning
<p align="justify">
This paper presents a deep learning based pipeline for categorizing Bengali toxic comments, in which at 
first a binary classification model is used to determine whether a comment is toxic or not, and then a multi-label 
classifier is employed to determine which toxicity type the comment belongs to. For this purpose, 
we have prepared a manually labeled dataset consisting of 16,073 instances among which 8,488 are _Toxic_ 
and any toxic comment may correspond to one or more of the six toxic categories â€“ _vulgar_, _hate_, _religious_, _threat_, _troll_, 
and _insult_ simultaneously. *Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with BERT Embedding* achieved 89.42% accuracy 
for the binary classification task while as a multi-label classifier, a combination of *Convolutional Neural Network* 
and *Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM) with attention mechanism* achieved 78.92% accuracy and 0.86 as weighted F1-score. 
To explain the predictions and interpret the word feature importance during classification by the 
proposed models, we utilized *Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)* framework.

There are one multi-label abusive comment dataset: Bangla-Abusive-Comment-Dataset https://github.com/aimansnigdha/Bangla-Abusive-Comment-Dataset and two multi-class hate speech and cyberbullying datasets: Bengali Hate Speech Dataset https://github.com/rezacsedu/Bengali-Hate-Speech-Dataset, Bangla Online Comments Dataset https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9xjx8twk8p/1 publicly available.
We have collected the text samples from these three datasets and categorize them manually in six classes: vulgar, hate, religious, threat, troll, insult where each sample text can be in multiple labels. For annotation purpose, we took help from three expert annotators and on the annotator's individual judgments for each class, we use the majority vote. There are in total 16,073 instances in the dataset. Among them 7,585 instances are Non-toxic and 8,488 instances are Toxic.

Class -> No. of instances

vulgar -> 2505                                                                 
hate -> 1898                                                                
religious -> 1418                                                                 
threat -> 1419                                                               
troll -> 1643                                                                
insult -> 2719
